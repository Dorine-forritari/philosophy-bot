# Philosophy Bot

This bot can be added to a Discord server. It responds to certain keywords like 'life', 'meaning', and 'why' with random philosophy quotes. Users can add and delete quotes themselves in the Discord server. These are the commands that can be used:

"$new " 	To add a new quote.  
"$del "		To delete a quote.  
"$list "	To see the list of current quotes.  

The bot runs in repl.it and stays active thanks to Uptime Robot.

I made this bot with the help of the tutorial by Beau Carnes from freecodecamp: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/
